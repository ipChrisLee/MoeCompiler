JavaGrunSupport is for grun of antlr4.
OJ may consider our project written in java if OJ found `.java` file or `'.java'` file.
To avoid this, JavaGrunSupport folder is add into `.gitignore`, so you should initialize this folder by you hand.
1.  First you should install antlr4. Read https://www.antlr.org for details.
2.  Second, just run `./initJavaGrunSupport.sh`
3.  And then you can run commands like `make grun sysy="testDir/test.sy"` in `moe`.

SysYTestCase is folder storing all test cases. Since [test cases](https://gitlab.eduxiji.net/nscscc/compiler2021/-/tree/master/公开用例与运行时库) is too large, you should load it by yourself.
You only need to load `function_test2020`, `function_test2021`, `performance_test2021-private` and `performanc_test2021-public`.
