This is folder for third party files.

`antlr4` is for antlr4 support. We need the files in this folder to compile our
compiler, so this is not ignored in git.

`SysYTestCase` is folder storing all test cases. Since [test cases](https://gitlab.eduxiji.net/nscscc/compiler2021/-/tree/master/公开用例与运行时库) is too large, you should load it by yourself.
You only need to load `function_test2020`, `function_test2021`, `performance_test2021-private` and `performance_test2021-public`.

`syLibFiles` are lib files of SysY.

`Google_Test` are lib files of GoogleTest. For test codes, we embrace them with
`#ifdef TESTING` and `#endif`, so this will cause compilation failure by OJ.
