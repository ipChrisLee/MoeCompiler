This is about what to do before reading source code and coding.

# Cross Compiler

To compile and run arm32 architecture code in our X86-64 computer, install some
applications by command line codes below:

```sh
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install qemu-user qemu-user-static gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu-dbg build-essential
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf binutils-arm-linux-gnueabihf-dbg
```

Read [ref](https://azeria-labs.com/arm-on-x86-qemu-user/) to know how to
compile, assemble link C files targeting at arm32 architecture in X84 computer.

# About static lib and dynamic lib

Read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/140061/when-to-use-dynamic-vs-static-libraries)
article to understand difference about static lib and dynamic lib.

We should treat `sylib` as static lib according to CSC2022 document. We will
talk about how to realize this later.

# `clang++` installation

Note that, according
to [this webpage](https://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/clang-on-ubuntu/):

> For one reason, Ubuntu doesnâ€™t have Clang 10, but it does have Clang 11, which
> is better due to its being a newer release. If you need Clang 11 on your Ubuntu
> system, start by opening up a terminal window.

So we will use the latest `clang`.

```sh
sudo apt-get install clang
```

# CLion supports

CLion has its antlr4 support, search in plugins.
